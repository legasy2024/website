    "section_1_paragraphs": [
      "Over the last few decades, tattooing in Cali has undergone a notable transformation. Initially linked to counterculture and urban subcultures, the practice arrived in the city in the late 20th century, influenced by global movements like rock, skateboarding, and hip-hop. These cultural elements opened the door to international techniques and styles, which gradually fused with Cali's rich cultural heritage, allowing tattooing to evolve from a marginal symbol to a respected form of artistic expression.",
      "Over time, the evolution of tattooing in Cali has been shaped by the innovation and creativity of local artists, who began developing unique styles that reflect Cali's identity. This evolution gave rise to high-quality studios that blend modern techniques with traditional Colombian aesthetics. Today, Cali is a major tattoo art hub in Colombia, known not only for its stylistic diversity, but also for artists committed to turning every stroke into a cultural and personal experience."
